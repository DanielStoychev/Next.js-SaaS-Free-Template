# ADR-0001: Technology Stack Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to select a modern, production-ready technology stack for a SaaS template that demonstrates best practices, type safety, developer experience, and scalability.

## Decision

### Frontend Framework: Next.js 14
**Chosen**: Next.js 14 with App Router
**Alternatives considered**: Remix, SvelteKit, Nuxt.js

**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for React applications
- Excellent performance with Server Components
- Built-in optimizations (images, fonts, bundling)
- Strong ecosystem and community support
- Vercel integration for seamless deployment

### Language: TypeScript
**Chosen**: TypeScript 5.5+ in strict mode
**Alternatives considered**: JavaScript, Flow

**Rationale**:
- Compile-time type checking prevents runtime errors
- Better developer experience with IDE support
- Industry standard for large applications
- Excellent tooling and ecosystem
- End-to-end type safety when combined with tRPC

### Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
**Chosen**: Tailwind CSS 3.4+ with shadcn/ui components
**Alternatives considered**: CSS-in-JS (styled-components, emotion), CSS Modules, Chakra UI

**Rationale**:
- Utility-first approach for consistent design
- Excellent performance (no runtime CSS-in-JS overhead)
- shadcn/ui provides high-quality, accessible components
- Easy theming and customization
- Great developer experience with IntelliSense

### Database: PostgreSQL + Prisma
**Chosen**: PostgreSQL 15+ with Prisma ORM
**Alternatives considered**: MySQL + TypeORM, MongoDB + Mongoose, Supabase

**Rationale**:
- PostgreSQL is robust, ACID compliant, and feature-rich
- Prisma provides excellent TypeScript integration
- Type-safe database queries
- Great migration system and developer tools
- Strong ecosystem and community

### Authentication: NextAuth.js v5
**Chosen**: NextAuth.js v5 (Auth.js)
**Alternatives considered**: Clerk, Supabase Auth, Firebase Auth, Custom JWT

**Rationale**:
- Framework-agnostic and Next.js optimized
- Supports multiple authentication providers
- Secure by default with built-in CSRF protection
- Active development and community
- Cost-effective (no per-user pricing)

### API Layer: tRPC
**Chosen**: tRPC 11.x with React Query
**Alternatives considered**: REST API, GraphQL (Apollo), Next.js API routes only

**Rationale**:
- End-to-end type safety from database to frontend
- Excellent developer experience with autocomplete
- No code generation required
- Built-in caching with React Query
- Perfect fit for TypeScript monorepos

### Payment Processing: Stripe
**Chosen**: Stripe API with webhooks
**Alternatives considered**: PayPal, Paddle, LemonSqueezy

**Rationale**:
- Industry leader with comprehensive features
- Excellent developer experience and documentation
- Strong fraud protection and compliance
- Flexible pricing models (subscriptions, usage-based)
- Global payment support

### Testing: Vitest + Playwright
**Chosen**: Vitest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E
**Alternatives considered**: Jest + Testing Library, Cypress

**Rationale**:
- Vitest: Fast, TypeScript native, great developer experience
- Playwright: Cross-browser testing, great debugging tools
- Both integrate well with the development workflow
- Active development and modern architecture

### Package Manager: pnpm
**Chosen**: pnpm
**Alternatives considered**: npm, yarn, bun

**Rationale**:
- Fastest installation and most efficient disk usage
- Excellent monorepo support
- Strict dependency resolution prevents phantom dependencies
- Growing adoption in the community

### Deployment: Vercel
**Chosen**: Vercel (primary), Docker (alternative)
**Alternatives considered**: Netlify, Railway, AWS, DigitalOcean

**Rationale**:
- Created by Next.js team, optimal integration
- Excellent developer experience with preview deployments
- Built-in analytics and performance monitoring
- Global edge network
- Generous free tier for development

### State Management: React Query
**Chosen**: TanStack Query (React Query) v5
**Alternatives considered**: Zustand, Redux Toolkit, SWR

**Rationale**:
- Perfect companion for tRPC
- Excellent caching and synchronization
- Built-in loading and error states
- Optimistic updates support
- Industry standard for server state management

### Code Quality: ESLint + Prettier
**Chosen**: ESLint with TypeScript plugin + Prettier
**Alternatives considered**: Rome (now Biome), StandardJS

**Rationale**:
- Industry standard with extensive plugin ecosystem
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Configurable rules for team preferences
- Great IDE integration
- Prettier ensures consistent formatting

### Monitoring: Sentry (Optional)
**Chosen**: Sentry for error tracking
**Alternatives considered**: Bugsnag, Rollbar, LogRocket

**Rationale**:
- Comprehensive error tracking and performance monitoring
- Excellent Next.js integration
- Great developer experience with source maps
- Generous free tier
- Industry standard

## Consequences

### Positive
- Modern, type-safe development experience
- Excellent performance and user experience
- Strong ecosystem and community support
- Production-ready with industry best practices
- Easy to hire developers familiar with the stack

### Negative
- Learning curve for developers new to these technologies
- Bundle size considerations with large dependency tree
- Potential over-engineering for simple applications
- Some technologies are relatively new (tRPC, App Router)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Gradual adoption path for complex features
- Bundle analysis and optimization
- Fallback strategies for critical dependencies

## Implementation Notes
- All versions specified are minimum versions
- Regular updates following semantic versioning
- Security patches applied promptly
- Breaking changes documented with migration guides

## Review Date
This ADR should be reviewed annually or when major version updates are available for core dependencies.
